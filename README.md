# QuranJSON
The Glorious Quran with the Uthmani Text in JSON format. The source of the text and the font can be found at https://fonts.qurancomplex.gov.sa/wp02/%D8%AD%D9%81%D8%B5#05

I used the Quran api available at https://alquran.cloud/api as the boiler plate and added the Uthmani text used in the Madina Mushaf. You will need the font UthmanicHafs1 Ver13(ver12 works fine as well) to display it properly.

I also added the Arabic numbers which are really the Indian numbers and named them numberInSurahNative to avoid confusion. In order to display the numbers correctly with the UthmanicHafs1 font, you need them in reversed order so I added numberInSurahNativeReverse as well. Just call the reversed numbers to display them properly.
