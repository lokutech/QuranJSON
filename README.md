# QuranJSON
The Glorious Quran with the Uthmani Text in JSON format.

I used the Quran api available at https://alquran.cloud/api as the boiler plate and added the Uthmani text used on the madina mushaf. You will need the font UthmanicHafs1Ex1Ver12.otf to display it properly

I also added the Arabic numbers which are really the Indian numbers and named them numberInSurahNative to avoid confusion. In order to display the numbers correctly with the UthmanicHafs1Ex1Ver12 font, you need them in reversed order so I added numberInSurahNativeReverse as well. Just call the reversed numbers to display them properly.
